# Preparation
## Introduction
Before deploying and managing applications in a Kubernetes cluster, it is important to set up the necessary infrastructure and resources. This preparation guide will walk you through the key steps needed to ensure a smooth and efficient deployment process.

In this section, weâ€™ll begin by setting up namespaces, which help logically organize and manage resources in your Kubernetes environment. Namespaces are useful for isolating environments, improving security, and simplifying resource management, especially when working with multiple teams or services.

Following these steps will create a solid foundation for deploying services into your Kubernetes cluster and managing them effectively.
## Steps

```bash
kubectl create namespace brokers
