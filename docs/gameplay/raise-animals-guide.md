### Construct A Home
Animals are livestock, and like humans, they require proper home. You can construct a coop or barn using gold at the shop. A building can house several animals and can be upgraded.
### Buy Animal
It's super easy â€” just purchase from the shop and place the animal in its home. There are many animals to choose from, such as chickens, cows, and more.


### Care and Management
Each animal has two states: young and adult. They need to be fed regularly.
- Young animals will get hungry after a certain period. If not fed, they will stop growing.
- Adult animals will produce output after each feeding and may get sick. If not treated in time, their output will be reduced by 50%.

### Tips
Visit your farm regularly and keep track of when your animals grow. They may become sick once they reach adulthood, so be sure to pay extra attention to them.

### NFT Intergration
You can purchase animal NFTs, which produce higher quality products, allowing you to harvest and earn more **$CARROT** token. The longer they stay alive, the more productive they become, increasing their value when sold on the marketplace. Animal NFTs will be introduced in upcoming updates.
