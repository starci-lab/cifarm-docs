In this section, we will teach you how to grow crops in CiFarm. It’s super easy! Start by buying seeds from the shop, then plant them on your farm tiles. Water them regularly, remove any weeds or pests, and keep an eye on their progress. Once your crops are ready, it's time to harvest and enjoy the rewards!

### Crop Care and Growth Guide

Seed packages can be bought in the shop with gold. Each crop has five phases, from seed to full maturity. Each phase needs a specific amount of time to develop, so be patient.

- Phase 1: Plant your seed and wait for it to begin growing.
- Phase 2 & 3: Your crop may need water at these stages, so be sure to check in regularly and water it if necessary, else they won't grow.
- Phase 4: At this stage, your crop could either become weedy or require inspection. If you don’t remove the weeds or complete the inspection, your crop’s productivity will be reduced by 50%.
- Phase 5: Once your crop has fully matured, it’s time to harvest.
Some plants are multi-season, so when you harvest them, they will return to Phase 3 and continue growing for another round of harvesting!

Once you harvest, you can sell all products for gold and experience points. Keep repeating this process to earn more gold, level up, and gain more chances to receive exclusive airdrops from us!
