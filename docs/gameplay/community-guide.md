CiFarm is an immersive, fully social game that encourages players to interact and collaborate within a vibrant farming community. 

### Visit Other Farms
You can explore other farms, assist with watering crops, remove weeds and insects, or even steal from them. Every action you take, including helping others, will earn you experience points (EXP) and help level up your character. You can only steal from farms that are at the same level or lower than yours, so staying active in the game is key to becoming a pro and maximizing your opportunities to earn rewards from other players.

CiFarm doesn’t offer huge rewards upfront; players must remain active in the game to earn and help others earn as well. This approach helps prevent inflation in the game and maintains a positive, engaging experience for all players.
### Invite Others
The more people you invite, the greater the in-game rewards you can earn. CiFarm uses this system to engage more players and expand the game’s community.

This strategy helps grow the user base quickly, especially at the start.
