# Hello, CiFarmers! ðŸ¥•
CiFarm, the top Solana-powered P2P farming game on Telegram, is launching soon with a range of groundbreaking features designed to enhance the farming game experience and surpass the competition in Telegram games.

"Farm, thief, earn" â€“ Cultivate crops, raise livestock, steal from them, and collect the rewards in CiFarm. ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸

CiFarm is hosted on CiWallet in Telegram, a custom wallet. This integration ensures that any transactions in the game occur smoothly and efficiently. Non-Web3 users can easily interact with the game, and as they become more familiar with the platform, they will have the opportunity to work with Web3 features such as tokens and NFTs.
